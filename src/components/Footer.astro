          I had a lot of fun making this. Over the course of a couple of months I ran through probably 60-70 layouts with at least a dozen completely different styles before finding my way to this SNES inspired direction.

          It's surprisingly challenging to find an aesthetic that feels like a reflection of yourself. I'm not sure I've quite nailed it yet, but I'm happy with where I landed for now. It's fun, and it's honest. 
        </p>

          In the process, I found Oh no Type Co. and was immediately hooked. Every typeface he makes has so much personality, the rest of the design can just build around them. They're like design cheat codes and I can't wait to play with more. I used Irregardless for headlines, Swear for body text, and Vulf Mono for small text and accents.

          From the tech side of things, the site is built with Astro, Tailwind, and some good ol' vanilla JS in script tags. I've been a fan of Tailwind since the early days and it continues to be a pleasure to work with. First time using Astro, but I'm already a big fan. It's a thin framework with great DX, and its primary design goal is to produce pages that are fast for end-users by default. A perfect fit for a site like this.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Lastly, the site is hosted on Netlify. Their DX is also fantastic, and Astro has support for deploying to Netlify out of the box.
