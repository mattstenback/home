          I had a lot of fun making this. Over the course of a couple of months I ran through probably 60-70 layouts with at least a dozen completely different styles before finding my way to this loosely SNES inspired direction.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          It’s surprisingly challenging to find an aesthetic that feels like a comfortable, balanced reflection of yourself. I’m not sure I’ve quite nailed it yet, and I’ll inevitably refresh it again in the future, but I’m happy with where I landed for the moment. It’s fun, and it’s honest. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In the process, I found <em>Oh no Type Co.</em> and was immediately hooked. Every typeface he makes has a ton of personality without compromising on readability or versatility. It’s really satisfying when the rest of a design just falls into place around the type (also kinda feels like cheating, but I’m not complaining). I used <em>Irregardless</em> for headlines, <em>Swear</em> for body text, and <em>Vulf Mono</em> for small text and accents.

          On the tech side of things, the site is built with <em>Astro</em>, <em>Tailwind</em>, and some good ol’ inline script tags with vanilla JS. I’ve been a fan of Tailwind since the early days and it continues to be a pleasure to work with. First time using Astro, but I’m already a big fan. It’s a thin framework with great DX, and its primary design goal is to produce pages that are fast for end-users by default. A perfect fit for a site like this.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Lastly, the site is hosted on <em>Netlify</em>. Their DX is also fantastic, and Astro has support for deploying to Netlify out of the box.
