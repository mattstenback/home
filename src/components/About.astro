      <span class="smallcaps">I’m a designer and developer</span> with a particular interest in UX, AI and security. I get up in the morning for a big vision, and I stay up late for the small details.

      I’ve been making software for 15 years. Currently I lead the application development team at Sequence Bio; building tools that support genetic research.
