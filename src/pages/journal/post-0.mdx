## The more complicated a system is, the harder it is to get it to do what you want.

<span class="smallcaps">The more complicated a system is,</span> the more things there are to think about, and the less of an idea you have about what’s going on. I get up in the morning for a big vision, and I stay up late for the small details that make it happen. I’m motivated by the why, obsessed with the how.

I’ve been making software for 15 years. Currently I lead the application development team at Sequence Bio; building tools that support genetic research.

In true generalist fashion, my work is a broad sampling of code, pixels, diagrams, and documents. From Figma, through the application stack, down to the infrastructure, and all the glue in-between.

I also like to bake.
