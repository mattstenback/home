## With the Diablo 4 beta behind us, I thought I'd take a run at redesigning some of the UI for fun while we wait for the full game to launch.

<span class="smallcaps">This just as much fan art</span> as it is a UI design exercise. _Practical fan art_ you might call it. The mockup above contains my core thoughts and notes about the changes I made, so I'll just set the stage here.

I didn't have a visceral reaction to the UI [like some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gTTnYhTs0&t=1157s), but I also wasn't completely indifferent towards it. After playing the beta for over 30 hours, the small rough edges in the UI did start to drag on me. And I'm not the only one; a handful of other designers have taken a crack at the UI as well and it's been fun to see the various perspectives. 

Also it's not lost on me that firing up Figma for a few hours on the weekend is miles away from shipping production UI. Blizzard clearly has talented designers working on the game who are managing a myriad of real-world design constraints which I get to be blissfully ignorant to.

To wrap up, I think the aesthetic of the current UI is great, but it suffers from some usability issues that make item information more difficult to scan and comprehend. My remix attempts to address those issues with some relatively small tweaks to the fundamentals.

Hope you enjoy the mockup!

PS. I have some thoughts on the inventory screen as well, but I'll save that for another post if I come up with something worth sharing.
